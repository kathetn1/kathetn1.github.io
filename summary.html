    <h2>INF 133 - Summary</h2>
	 
	  <h3>User Research</h3>
	  <h4>
		  <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uci.edu/spreadsheets/d/1C5dpoTyjQx1iON1TQu6MzteWCvlMCnP-P4XW14QXhX8/edit?usp=sharing">
			  User Interviews
		  </a>
	  </h4>
	  <p>In the user interviews, I used the standard questions that were given as default. From the interviews, 
		  I learned about what my peers were expecting and looking for in a web portfolio. I also learned about their personal
		  experiences with creating their own web portfolios and their job experience.  Overall, everyone has a similar goal of 
		  finding a stable job after college or gaining more experience in the field.
	  </p>

			   Competitor Analysis
		  </a>
	  </h4>
	  <p>I thought all of the sites were unique and I wish I had previous experience to make my site seem as fluid and creative as theirs.
		  They all had their own unique styles and different ways to present their information. </p>
	  
	  <h4>
		  <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uci.edu/spreadsheets/d/1Cb4AgEKy69R1c1a-YFHAVjK6uNsT_ywz1IItJ96C2Ao/edit?usp=sharing">
			  Feature Value Matrix
		  </a>
	  </h4>
	  <p>I chose these features based on what I thought users would be looking for in a portfolio.  I ranked them based on that as well. </p>
	  
	  <h4>
		  <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uci.edu/presentation/d/1aKDqZOl3elI1TFRrXTyCf7fxermzBbQYpU1WVinrd5E/edit?usp=sharing">
			  Feature Prioritization
		  </a>
	  </h4>
	  <p>Based on my thoughts from the Feature Value Matrix, I graphed it accordingly and kept those points in mind while creating my site.  Not all of this 
		  worked and I had to make some compromises for the sake of time.</p>
	  
	  <h3>User Testing</h3>
	  <h4>
		  <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uci.edu/spreadsheets/d/1TOBsWCPGARgdI8Ya8P5QlnEMJBt5W5n21zPXufQUlJg/edit?usp=sharing">
			   User Stories
		  </a>
	  </h4>
	  <p>The user stories were helpful because it allowed me to focus more on what users might actually be looking for or looking at 
		  when they view the site.</p>
	  
	  <h4>
		  <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uci.edu/spreadsheets/d/1BthRK4ASXr6iZIF7tMKUnaHgES5ax9As0-D1tgcz_AQ/edit?usp=sharing">
			  Cognitive Walkthroughs
		  </a>
	  </h4>
	  <p>Cognitive Walkthroughs helped me understand how people actually really used my site.  What they liked, what they disliked, what was 
		  easy to find, what was more difficult.</p>
	  
	  <h4>
		  <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/a6ee3361ddaa/results/33cb561bcb08">
			  Click Test - Helped me get a quantitative value on what people would try to click in order to find resume or skill set.
		  </a>
		  <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/8eca6ccac4aa/results/d8bc4dfaa601">
			  Question Test - Similarly helped me get feedback on the level of difficulty to navigate the site.

	  <h3>Summary of Findings</h3>
	  
    <p id="paragraph">After the User Testing portion, some of the feedback I received: </p>
    
    <ul>
    	<li>Change the color scheme</li>
        <li>Too many images</li>
        <li>Information is not easy to find</li>
        </ul>
        
        
	  <h3>Incorporation of Findings</h3>
    <p id="paragraph">Some of the features I changed: </p>
    
    <ul>
    	<li>Color Scheme</li>
        <li>Layout</li>
        <li>Fonts</li>
        <li>Added Menu Button</li>
        </ul>

	    <p id="paragraph">A lot of the changes I implemented were things I knew I wanted to do after I had submitted the midterm project, but I didn't have enough time to figure out how to do everything I wanted.</p>
